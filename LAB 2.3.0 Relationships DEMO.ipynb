As the sample gets bigger, the t-distribution curve approaches that of the normal (Gaussian) distribution. The sample size of 30 is considered to be sufficiently large for the t-distribution curve to be interchangeable with the normal distribution curve. Hence, with sample sizes greater than 30 we can perform the hypothesis test for the mean of a population using a normal distribution curve, or the z-test, after the z-distribution (the normal distribution with mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1). \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the setosa set from the previous section to apply the z-test twice."

    "- the standard deviation within the sets needs to be the same or the set sizes need to be the same, with similar distributions\n",

    "- the variables should be independent\n",

Let's just assume independence i.e. that the collection of data was really completely random for each species (in the case that one species data were collected at one time of the year and those for another later on, the data would not be independent). The set sizes are the same. We can draw histograms to get a rough idea of the distributions. From these we see that the distributions are roughly normal."
